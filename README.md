## Notes

One of the main challenges I had was understanding how the ViewHolder, Adapter, and the RecyclerView components worked in unison. I did not understand which 
each component did, thus it was hard to program these components properly. Once I read the CodePath guide, I figured out how they worked and I was able to 
complete the project. I also found adding wishlist items to my RecyclerView difficult since I did not know where to instantiate the adapter. After browsing
the CodePath instructions for lab 2, I found that the adapter should be outside of the submit button's onClickListener to successfully render on the app.
